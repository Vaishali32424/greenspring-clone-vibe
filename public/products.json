It can cure a variety of  ailments from such as fatigue and cancer and to cure impotency. It is  also known as Caterpillar fungus (English) and Yartsa Gungu (Tibetan). Keeda Jadi is basically a fungus which grows as a parasite on the larvae  of a particular kind of caterpillar.

Caterpillars take 5 years to grow  underground in Alpine grass and shrub lands before finally pupating  (from larva) and are attacked by the fungus while feeding on roots. It  finally takes the shape of 5-15 centimeter columnar mushroom out of the  forehead of the caterpillar. It is mostly found in Darchula in Mahakali  zone in the Nepal and India.

Botanically it belongs to the thistle family of asteraceae, of the genus; cynara. Scientific name: Cyanarascolymus. Artichoke is low in calories and fat, but is a rich source of dietary fiber; provides 5.4 g per 100 g, about 14% of rda. Dietary fiber helps control constipation conditions, decrease bad or ldl cholesterol levels by binding to it in the intestines and helps prevent colon cancer risks by preventing toxic compounds in the food from absorption. Scientific studies have shown that bitter principles, cynarin and sesquiterpene- lactones in artichoke extraction have overall cholesterol reduction action in the body by inhibiting its synthesis and increasing its excretion in the bile. Fresh artichoke is an excellent source of vitamin folic acid; provides about 68 mcg per 100 g (17% of recommended daily allowance). Folic acid acts as a co-factor for enzymes involved in the synthesis of DNA. Scientific studies have proven that adequate levels of folates in the diet during pre-conception period and during early pregnancy help prevent from neural tube defects in the newborn baby. It is also rich in b-complex group of vitamins such as niacin, vitamin b-6 (pyridoxine), thiamin, and pantothenic acid that are essential for optimum cellular metabolic functions. It is one of the vegetable sources for vitamin k; provides about 12% of dry. Vitamin k has potential role bone health by promoting osteotrophic (bone formation) activity.
